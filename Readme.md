# YOLO Object Detection Model Training

This repository contains code to train a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model using a custom dataset. The training pipeline utilizes the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework for fast and efficient object detection.

## üß† Model

This project uses the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) implementation, which supports various YOLO model sizes including `yolov8n`, `yolov8s`, `yolov8m`, `yolov8l`, and `yolov8x`.
